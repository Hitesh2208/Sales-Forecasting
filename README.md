"# Sales-Forecasting" 
â€” This work proposes the implementation of a
sound sales forecasting system that is embedded in a Flask
web application framework with Machine learning and
Deep learning. The problem is to forecast item demand
across the stores based on the historical sales data
available. The current time series analysis is done using
ARIMA, Random Forest and Linear Regression models
are used for baseline comparison while LSTM networks
are used for sequential analysis. The collected data is
preprocessed with great efficiency using pandas and
numpy libraries, while visualization is done with
matplotlib for greater analysis insight. The introduced
models were further assessed by the performance
indicators, which encompassed Mean Squared Error
(MSE) and forecast clarity. The analysis shows that the
proposed LSTM model is superior to conventional models
in the analysis of complex sales patterns especially where
demand fluctuation is high. The findings from the
forecasting models indicated that well-trained ARIMA
forecasts were suitable for sharing stationary or stationary
seasonal data, while other ensembles, such as Random
Forest, were effective in addressing nonlinear
relationships. The system also supports the SQLite in user
authentication to provide individualized forecast output.
Thus, the project effectively presents how such highlyalgorithmic tools as state-of-art forecasting models might
be utilized within an easy-to-use web application, which
would provide a great potential of improving inventory
management an retailing business.
